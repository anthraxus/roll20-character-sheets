    John is completely and utterly batshit insane. You are one of the Voices in his head. You have one task you are secretly obsessed with. 
    Your goal is to get John to do that thing as many times as possible (whether you're in control or not). 
    Obsessions are ranked by difficulty: 1 (e.g. steal a candy bar), 2 (e.g. steal a car), or 3 (e.g. steal the Eiffel Tower)
    <br />
    <br />
    John is barely-functional at times, and a fucking wizard at times. When he does something that an ordinary person would have any chance of failing, 
    he rolls a die (d6). If he rolls a 6, he succeeds. Otherwise, he fails miserably. If the current Voice has a relevant skill, though, 
    John succeeds on a roll of 3 or more. The current Voice may also spend willpower before they roll to boost their roll by that many points.
    <br />
    <br />
    Any time John gets hurt, wakes up, fails a roll, or completes the active voice's obsession, a struggle for control takes place. 
    Any voice that wants to take control secretly chooses how much willpower they want to bid, then all reveal their bids. 
    Highest bid gets control and pays that much willpower. Ties end in a roll-off.
    <br />
    <br />
    John is easily bored. If nothing exciting happens for 10 minutes, the GM rolls a die. 4+ and John falls asleep. 
    When this happens, every Voice gains 1 willpower and a bid for control happens when he wakes up.
    <br />
    <br />
    The game ends when John dies, or everyone is out of willpower. Each voice multiplies the number of times they copmleted their obsession by its rank to 
    get their final score. Highest wins.
